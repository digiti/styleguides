### A note on tabs

*Soft tabs* are made up of spaces.  
*Hard tabs* are made up of a tab character.

There's an eternal discussion going on about which is better, e.g.:

* [Tabs versus Spaces](http://www.jwz.org/doc/tabs-vs-spaces.html)
* [Never use hard tabs](http://opensourcehacker.com/2012/05/13/never-use-hard-tabs/)
* [Tabs are evil](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/TabsAreEvil)

Above all consistency is important,  
so below are the standards which we've agreed upon per language.
